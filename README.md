# RayTracer

This is an update of the raytracer skeleton from the book "Raytracing from the Ground Up" by Kevin Suffern..

# (Intended) Changes

- Switch to Qt5 to achieve one codebase for all platforms.

- Tidy up C++ style to be more C++11/14 compliant.

- Switch from classic object pointers to using C++11 `shared_ptr`/`weak_ptr` where suitable

# Status

Incomplete (so far) - I'm still half-way through remapping the old Wx UI to a Qt one, then I'll tidy up
C++ syntax.
